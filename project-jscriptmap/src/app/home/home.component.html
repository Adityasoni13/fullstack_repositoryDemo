             <p style="padding: 40px;">
                Exploring wildlife has always been fun especially in places where wild animals have
                become a part of culture and mythology. India has many sanctuaries and national parks
                 that have been established the endangered species. With the efforts of government and public,
                  many wildlife conservation areas are thriving and giving a chance to people to the animals
                   closely. In India, most of the forests are dense and are accompanied by water bodies, hills, 
                   ravines, etc. Therefore, wildlife safari in any of the sanctuaries in India is adventurous and memorising.

            <p style="padding: 40px;">It’s hardly an exaggeration to say that India’s civilization is one of the oldest in
                 the world. All throughout its history, it has witnessed the rise and fall of several
                  kings, dynasties and empires. Each of those in power, however, left behind their
                   legacy in the form of a monument, maybe a fort, palace or any other historical 
                   structure. Apart from that, there are temples and caves which bear testament to the 
                   artistic excellence attained in the past ages. These places of historical importance
             aren’t just significant as tourist destinations, they also attract lovers of art and history.</p>

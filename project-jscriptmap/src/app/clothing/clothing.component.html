       <strong>Traditional clothing</strong>  in India greatly varies across different parts of the country and is influenced by
         local culture, geography, climate, and rural/urban settings. Popular styles of dress include draped
          garments such as sari and mekhela sador for women and dhoti or lungi or panche (in Kannada) for men.
           Stitched clothes are also popular such as churidar or salwar-kameez for women, with dupatta (long scarf)
            thrown over shoulder completing the outfit. The salwar is often loose 
        fitting, while churidar is a tighter cut. The dastar, a headgear worn by Sikhs is common in Punjab. <br> <br>
       <strong>Indian women</strong>  perfect their sense of charm and fashion with makeup and ornaments. Bindi, mehendi,
         earrings, bangles and other jewelry are common. On special occasions, such as marriage ceremonies
          and festivals, women may wear cheerful colours with various ornaments made with gold, silver or
           other regional stones and gems. Bindi is often an essential part of a Hindu woman's make up. Worn
            on their forehead, some consider the bindi as an auspicious mark. Traditionally, the red bindi was 
            worn only by married Hindu women, and coloured bindi was worn by single women, but now all colours
             and glitter have become a part of women's fashion. Some women wear sindoor â€“ a traditional red or
              orange-red powder (vermilion) in the parting of their hair (locally called mang). Sindoor is the 
              traditional mark of a married woman for Hindus. Single Hindu women do not wear sindoor; neither
               do over 1 million Indian women from religions other than Hindu and agnostics/atheists who may
                be married. <br> <br> The make up and clothing styles differ regionally between the Hindu groups,
                 and also by climate or religion, with Christians preferring Western and Muslim preferring the
                  Arabic styles. For men, stitched versions include kurta-pyjama and European-style trousers 
                  and shirts. In urban and semi-urban centres, men and women of all religious backgrounds,
         can often be seen in jeans, trousers, shirts, suits, kurtas and variety of other fashions.
